PHPStorm

PHPStorm listen button is for xdebug only not for javascript
It works based on bug symbol
Please note that doc is to debug node (backend) not frontend (react etc)

Run / Edit Configurations...

Just go to packages.json
next to each npm command it will show play button (on left)
right click it and select debug
make sure debug point is in node backend code, not frontend code like react

And that's all
if any issues pkill node

Code Run / Debug / Debug configuration
Working directory /Volumes/sensetive/js/merchant-integration-api
script path src/local_snippets/utils/debug.js

make sure phpstorm has picked-up correct nodejs version/executable etc
break points are either from IDE
or from keyword debugger;



main project debug has several approaches
one is to use ts-node
you need to add files parameter
ts-node --files src/index.ts

alternative  add /// <reference path="global.d.ts" />
in index.ts
and other places where some type file needs to be loaded, --files is much better

but this won't be useful in debugging inside phpstorm, so need to add environment variable
TS_NODE_FILES=true

phpstorm requires extra params to debug typescript using ts-node
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/running-and-debugging-typescript.html

but if you have included ts-node locally you will need to pass full path in param
like --require /Users/zain/.nvm/versions/node/v10.18.0/lib/node_modules/ts-node/register
did not work with ~/.nvm/....
